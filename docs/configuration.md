```

### Notifications

You can configure to be notified when deployment starts to succeeds.

##### `notifications`

The list of different chat/IRC clients through which notifications can be sent.

```yml

```yml
room_id: HIPCHAT_ROOM_ID
```

##### `hipchat.auth_token`

```yml

```yml

auth_token: ${HIPCHAT_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

### Notified Scripts

If you want to be notified for custom scripts just like deployments, you can list the scripts that should be notified in the `notified_hooks.scripts` block as shown below.

Configuration could be as simple as:

```yml
project_name: my-app
scripts:
  db_migration: 'yarn db:migrate'
  db_rollback: 'yarn db:rollback'
  reload: 'pm2 reload'

notifications:
  slack:
    ...
  hipchat:
    ...

notified_hooks:
  scripts: ['reload', 'db_migration', 'db_rollback']
```

Now, if the user executes the command:

```
$ fab staging run:db_migration
```

In hipchat or slack, the notifications would look like:

```
- kabir is running db_migration for my-app on staging server.
- kabir finished running db_migrate for my-app on staging server.
```
